## 👨‍💻 About Me

🎓 ECE student specializing in Embedded Systems and IoT.  
🛠️ Hands-on experience in microcontroller-based design, firmware development and hardware–software integration.  
💻 Worked with ESP32, STM32, LPC2148, ESP8266 and Arduino.  
🔌 Experienced in GPIO, ADC, UART, SPI, I2C and PWM interfacing.  
🌐 Built IoT systems with cloud connectivity, real-time data acquisition and remote monitoring.  
🚗 Developed an AI-enabled EV Battery Swapping Hub and smart automation projects.  
🏭 Completed a 6-month industrial internship in PCB assembly and quality inspection.  
📄 Published a research paper in IJRAR on IoT-enabled monitoring systems.  
⚡ I try to spend at least 1 hour every day learning STM32 and improving my embedded system design skills.
